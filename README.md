# Machine-Learning-Coursework-Project
# ST3189: Assessed Coursework Project
You will undertake a project that will determine your final mark of the course by
30 per cent. The project will require you to analyse one or more real-world
datasets of your choice. You can use the OpenML website, the UCI repository, or
any other open access domain to select your dataset(s).
The project will consist of completing the following three tasks that can be
implemented on one or more of your chosen real-world datasets.
1. Unsupervised Learning: where the problem consists of identifying
homogeneous population groups or dimension reduction techniques, which
can then be used in the context of the empirical application
2. Regression: where the problem consists of continuous target variable(s).
3. Classification: where problem consists of categorical target variable(s).
   
You will be expected to present each of the datasets you are analysing, identify
research questions that can be addressed by your analysis and, ideally, present
relevant existing literature and contrast your results against it. You are expected to
use multiple technique for the regression and classification tasks, and compare
their results.
In all cases, your analysis should be presented in a paper like format, avoiding
highly technical language where possible. It may be helpful to think of your
audience as consisting of people with some quantitative background but no prior
knowledge of Machine Learning. Your ability to present and interpret the results
will be regarded as important as your ability to apply the taught techniques.
