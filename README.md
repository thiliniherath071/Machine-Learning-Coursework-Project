# Machine-Learning-Project
The project will require to analyse one or more real-world
datasets of your choice. You can use the OpenML website, the UCI repository, or
any other open access domain to select your dataset(s).
The project will consist of completing the following three tasks that can be
implemented on one or more of your chosen real-world datasets.
1. Unsupervised Learning: where the problem consists of identifying
homogeneous population groups or dimension reduction techniques, which
can then be used in the context of the empirical application
2. Regression: where the problem consists of continuous target variable(s).
3. Classification: where problem consists of categorical target variable(s).
